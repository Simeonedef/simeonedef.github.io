Growing up, going to piano lessons at the conservatory, with the same teacher for about 10 years, he and I would always start our lessons with a bit of small talk. Ranging from what I have been learning at school, to life habits, no stones were left unturned.

On one of these occasions, we talked about the importance of doing nothing, not reading, not thinking, not listening, really just letting your mind freewheel. It's hard to explain what that feels like if you've never experience it, but essentially, it's similar to walking aimlessly and seeing where you end up without interfering, but in your mind. Growing up, I had always had the habit of daydreaming, living a reality pieced together in my head rather than the one in front of my eyes. I believe it is in those moments that I figured out bit by bit who I wanted to be, what I wanted my life to look and feel like.

When I was living with my parents, I rarely had the time to do nothing. I had a jam-packed schedule, courtesy of my mother and whenever she would see me doing nothing I was assailed with a list of things to do. Even during breaks from school I was reminded that holidays were there to allow us to catch up on things we were not able to do during the rest of the year. My doing nothing time became my short walks to school in the morning, the car rides to my music school and the however many tens of minutes before falling asleep in the evening. Even with as little time as this, I still remember laying in bed thinking about what I want people to remember of me, how I picture my life after my parents, deciding how much of myself I want to give to the world. I suppose those are very basic questions that are probably answered instinctively, but at 13 years old, nothing felt instinctive, instead I felt like I designed my own system of rules and values that still follow me to this day. Whether I have developed a way to follow my instincts or if I have just internalized my rules is still up for debate.

During my undergraduate degree, I had a lot of time to do nothing and instead to think. While I hated the fact that I had this much free time, looking back on it now I realize that no time was genuinely wasted. Having the luxury to do nothing allowed me to dream in more detail, dreams that later on I would formulate into plans and decide the feasibility of. From picking up new hobbies, to developing different facets of my personality, my mind was never truly idle. I like to think that I follow my heart in every aspect of my life, and it is during those moments of nothing that I can feel what I want rather than think about what I want.

More concretely, I also realized that when I'm feeling overwhelmed by the tasks ahead of me, sometimes the best thing to do is to go for a walk and do nothing for a bit. Just enough time for the dust to settle and to look at things from a fresh perspective. While I'm still battling with the constant memento mori of passing time and wasted time, I am slowly learning to rationalize with myself that no time is truly ever wasted. Doing nothing is when I am at my most creative, I can finally remove all the barriers I put up for myself and feel and think unrestrained until actionable steps become clear.

I have suffered a lot from the dizzying carousel of always chasing the next activity or planning for it. When do I actually enjoy the present moment ? Will I remember the time and energy I spent planning for the next activity ? As it turns out, what I remember are the thoughts, the feelings I have felt, the moments doing nothing that have shaped my life and my vision of the world.
