Hello welcome to my personal blog.

Here I plan on writing about thoughts, ideas, plans or observations that I encounter
at work or in my academic work.

I am currently a student in Computer Science Artificial Intelligence at the University
of Manchester. I was previously at the Ecole Jeannine Manuel in Paris. We could say
that I am an international kid, fluent in french, english and chinese, from a franco-chinese family. Although it may not seem like it as everyone from non francophone countries has a lot of trouble attempting to pronounce my first name,
and we could say that my last name could not get any more french.

My work experiences so far have been quite eclectic. I founded a non-profit organization in high school promoting international comprehension between french and chinese youths. I also founded a Youtube network around the same time focused on fostering a community of small to mid sized french channels on various topics. My Youtube experiences include motion design, graphic design, SEO, etc. This led me to land an internship at Perfect World Entertainment in Beijing (known for being the publishers of DOTA 2 and CSGO in China) working in their Events and Brand team, where I was a motion designer creating assets for ChinaJoy 2017. This summer, I am working as a business analyst in mobile strategy for China at Air France in the digital department, where I am working on a China optimization taskforce where we work on introducing china-friendly features, apps, website optimizations.

On a more personal note, I am also quite an avid classical pianist, former student from the municipal conservatory in Paris and a (very) sub-par rock guitarist. On a more unoriginal note, I have quite an interest in video games as many fellow computer scientists do; however, I take my nerdiness to a whole new level occasionally streaming and posting videos on Youtube.
